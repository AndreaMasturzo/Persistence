Think about all the moments and the opportuinities you let go in your life. All the possibilities that were presented in front of you and you let them slip away. 

Persistence is a constant reminder of never leaving anything behind ourselves. 

I developed this project in pure SwiftUI to test the boundaries of this framework and the new Playground App. The first part is story-driven and suggestive presenting a black screen and minimum user interaction. 

This leads to the core, a blackboard with a twist: every line you draw will disappear after a while so the only way to save your work is to keep retracing over and over or to think fast and take a screenshot before everything will fade away.
